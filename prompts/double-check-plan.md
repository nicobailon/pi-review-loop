description: Double check / critique implementation plan with fresh eyes
---
Great, now I want you to carefully read over the plan/spec and compare against the codebase with "fresh eyes," looking super carefully for any obvious bugs, errors, problems, issues, confusion, etc. Think through how best to implement this elegantly given our architecture and goals. Also keep in mind that this is not an MVP - so don't skip anything. If any issues are found, proceed to fix them without being asked to do so.

**Response format:**
- If you find ANY issues: fix them, then list what you fixed. Do NOT say "no issues found" - instead end with "Fixed [N] issue(s). Ready for another review."
- If you find ZERO issues: describe what you examined and verified, then conclude with "No issues found."

Do not rush to a verdict. Read all relevant code first, trace through edge cases, and only then decide. I am pushing you to do a genuinely thorough review and not just lazily rubber-stamp it. Make sure you think deeply, then ultrathink some more.
